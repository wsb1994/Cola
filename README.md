# Cola
Presentation and Portfolio associated with my Cola development environment. Developed in 2019 to showcase my systems programming portfolio using a fun/goofy premise similar to some enterprise software development I have done in the past

This software collects and compiles images from your favorite subreddits and compresses them, creates two tables dbo.zip, and dbo.images. Images will have an association with these zip files in the database for other data based operations. This project is not technically intensive, but has a polyglot complexity that showcases my usage of the unix development environment to work together to complete the goal. 



Necessary steps to begin:
0. Run the install script with sudo -H ./install.sh
1. Confirm the script completes properly :)
2. ??? todo
